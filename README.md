## ✨ Project Overview

**Biggan Pathshala** is a modern, interactive, and fully localized science tutorial, blog, and quiz platform. Students can learn science in simple language, ask questions, and create or share their own content. The platform blends the interactivity of social media with the depth of a knowledge-sharing hub.

## 🚩 Problem & Solution

Many students in Bangladesh and beyond struggle to connect with science due to a lack of engaging, localized resources and supportive communities. There is no central space for learning, asking, and contributing knowledge in Bangla or English in a simple, interactive way.

**Our Solution:**

- Peer-to-peer science Q&A inspired by Facebook and StackOverflow
- Publish tutorials/blogs on science topics (school to university level)
- AI-powered features: auto-answering science questions, summarizing blogs/tutorials
- Gamification: learning score, reputation, contribution
- Support for both Bangla and English content
- Friendly, collaborative, and open-source environment
